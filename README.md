## Task: 

Process data based on clinical trial results. Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, 
Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment 
regimens.

Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen 
throughout the course of the study.
